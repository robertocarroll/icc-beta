## Links
For search engines, accessibility and good practice, do not use “click here” for links. Make the link descriptive – explaining what the link offers - preferably matching the title of the document you are linking to and make sense when read out of context. 

### Example 
Instead of “For more information on the structure of the ICC, click here” write “See who's who at the International Criminal Court for more information”.

Links are the fundamental basis of the web. Internal links (ones between different parts of your own website) help to create a rich experience, prevent repeating large chunks of text and help improve rankings with search engines. For example, don’t include a long section from the RPE; link to the rule instead.  
It’s good to put relevant links quite early in the body copy and not too densely bunched (e.g. every 200 words).

- Speak to the focus of the page
- Don’t use abbreviations, e.g. International Criminal Court not ICC if possible
- Include who the article or page is about if possible
