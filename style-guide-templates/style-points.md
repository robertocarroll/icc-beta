Follow The Oxford Style Manual, Oxford University Press if a point is not covered here.

## Abbreviations and acronyms
Use the full name with the abbreviation in brackets on first use on a page unless it is very well known. Afterwards use the initials. Only include the initials in brackets if you are going to use them later. 

### Example
- Use the Victims and Witnesses Unit (VWU) at first mention. Use the VWU subsequently.   
- Use the Victims and Witnesses Unit if it is only mentioned once.  

Don't use full stops except for:
- B.C., A.D.
- B.A. and other academic degrees
- H.E. for His/Her Excellency

## Ampersands
Use “and“ in most cases. Use & when part of a company name. 
	
## Brackets
Use curly brackets (like this) rather than square brackets \[not like this\]. Use square brackets to make amendments to quoted material and to provide translations or explanations of titles left in another language.

## Bullet points
Use bullet points and lists to break up text and make it easier to read. 

Start with an introductory sentence which ends in a colon:
- begin with a lower-case letter and end with a semi-colon;
- end the last item in a full stop, unless the sentence continues below it. 

If the list items are complete sentences begin with an upper-case later and end with a full stop.

## Capital letters
Use lower case for some terms, e.g. the parties and participants in proceedings, in general references, but capitalised in specific references. 

### Examples
Use “the accused” for general references, but “the Accused” when referring to a specific accused person or persons, and “the rights of the defence” (as a general concept), but: “the rights of the Defence for Thomas Lubanga”.

Use a statement from the deceased victim’s family, but: a statement from the family of deceased Victim a/0051/08.

Titles of Court filings should have only the initial letter capitalised.

Capitalise “state” for States Parties and references to a specific country or government. Use lower case in most other instances.

Article, rule, regulation, page, paragraph, chapter and note are not capitalised.

Surnames use initial capital (not all capitals), e.g. Jean-Pierre Bemba not Jean-Pierre BEMBA. 

Don't capitise the letter after a colon.

Capitalise The Hague but not the Netherlands. 

## Currency 
Use the currency symbol before the amount without a space, e.g.
€120 000; $25.86

Currency names are lower case, e.g. pound, dollar, euro

## Contractions
Use contractions, e.g. it’s, who’s, don’t, can’t, won’t, except in very formal text. 

## Dates and times
Day month year, in that order, with no commas and no additions to the day. Don’t use the numbers-only date format.

25 October 2011
July 2011
5 July 
2010---11
1999---2001 but from 1999 to 2001 
1990s - No apostrophe

Use 12-hour clock followed by a.m. or p.m., e.g. 11.30 a.m.  

Use midnight not “12 midnight”.

## E.g., etc., and i.e.
Use full stops between and after these terms. Abbreviate if it doesn't disrupt the sentence: “for example“ and “specifically“ can be clearer.   

## Email addresses
Use links for email addresses and write them in full. 

## Gender-neutral language
Don't use the generic “he” or “they” instead of “he or she”. Use plural forms of nouns where possible. If not, use “he or she”, “his or her” and “his or hers” but avoid repetition, which can quickly make sentences clumsy.

## Judgment not judgement
No middle “e” (“judgment”) for a legal ruling. Don't change the spelling (“judgement”) in a direct quotation or the title of a judgment from another court.

## Hyphens and dashes
Hyphens join words and have no spaces on either side, e.g. “Pre-Trial Chamber”.

Use an en dash with a space either side to – like this – to break up a sentence. Don't use a hyphen.  

## Italics
Italicise Latin and other foreign-language expressions. Don't use inverted commas. 

Don't italicise “ad hoc“, “per capita“, “per se“, “amicus curiae“ as they are in common use. 

## Legal text references
When refering to articles, rules or regulations from the Court’s basic texts, the numbers and letters of sub-paragraphs are separated by brackets with a space between the word “article” etc. and the number, e.g. article 90(2)(a), rule 119(1)(a), regulation 58(3).

Avoid repeating large chunks of legal text. For example, don’t include a long section from the Rome Statute; link to the artile instead.  

## Links
Links are the fundamental basis of the web. Internal links (ones between different parts of our website) help to create a rich experience, prevent repeating large chunks of text and help improve rankings with search engines.   

For search engines, accessibility and good practice, do not use “click here” for links. Make the link descriptive – explaining what the link offers - preferably matching the title of the document you are linking to and make sense when read out of context. 

### Example
Instead of “For more information on the structure of the ICC, click here” write “See [who's who at the International Criminal Court](link) for more information”.

## Numbers
Numbers up to and including ten should be written out. Try not to begin a sentence with a number, but if you do write the number in words. 

Write percentages as numbers or spelled out, as appropriate in the context. 

Separate big numbers with spaces not commas, e.g. 2 500 000.

## Place names
Use English forms, The Hague, not Den Haag or ‘s-Gravenhage;
Senegal, not Sénégal. 

Exceptions: Côte d’Ivoire, not Ivory Coast; Timor-Leste, not East Timor.

Use a comma between city and country, e.g. Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo; Darfur, Sudan

Use the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but Sudan (no the).

## Quotes and speech marks
Quotation marks and apostrophes should be smart (“…”), not straight ("…").

Do not use “scare quotes” around colloquial or slang words or phrases.

### Single quotes
Use single quotation marks for quotations within a quotation.

### Double quotes
Use double quotation marks for first-level quotations.

### Block quotes
Use a block quote for long quotes. Don't begin or end with quotation marks. Mark a block quote like this:

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote. 

## Spaces
One space after a full stop. Not two.

## Spelling 
Use British English rather American English. 

### Examples
Use “-ise” not “-ize”. Both forms are permissible in British English. However, for ease of use, -ise is preferred because there is not a need to learn a long list of exceptions.

The “-yse” form for such words as “paralyse” and “analyse” is the only correct spelling in British English.

Use “-ct-” not “-x-” in “connection” and “reflection”.

## Titles
The page title is very important. It tells users and search engines what the page is about: 

- No more than 70 characters if possible. 
- Speak to the focus of the page.
- Don’t use abbreviations, e.g. International Criminal Court not ICC if possible.
- Include who the article or page is about if possible.
