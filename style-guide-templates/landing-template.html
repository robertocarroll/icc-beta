				<p>Print <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/znm5c0l4256lrg8/ICC-content-checklist-D1-R1.pdf?dl=0">this content checklist</a> and work through the points.</p>

				<p>Many of the features on this page are flexible and optional based on the content. They are included here to show what is possible in general.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>You have 100 words (at most) to give a broad overview of your work. Tell users what you actually do.</li>
					<li>More detail (if necessary) can go in the <a href="how-we-work-template.html">How we work content template</a> which is a link at the end of the overview.</li>
					<li>Featured links are optional. The fewer the better. These are intended to direct the user to the most relevant information for your organ or department across the ICC website.</li>
					<li>The sections below (statements/announcements) are flexible and will depend on your needs (see <a href="content-templates.html#landing-examples">landing section examples</a> for each organ and department). It is possible to feature content and to create lists showing the latest three of a certain type.</li>
					<li>Biographies will link to individual biographies (see <a href="content-templates.html#biography">biography template and examples</a>).</li>
					<li>Include contact details if appropriate (see <a href="content-templates.html#contact">Contact template and examples</a>).</li>
