	<h2 id="overview">Writing for the ICC</h2>
	<p>The new ICC website aims to serve existing users better as well as to attract and engage a wider audience about the importance of the ICC and the effects of its work.</p>

	<ul>
					<li>Quicker, easier, clearer</li>
					<li>More vibrant, more human, more engaging</li>
					<li>More efficient, more effective</li>
					<li>Accessible by everyone, everywhere</li>
			</ul>	

	<p>The following guidance will help us achieve these aims and make information on the ICC website clear and easy to understand.</p>   	

	<h3>Start with user needs</h3>
	<ul>
					<li>Write with a particular user in mind</li>
					<li>Ask yourself: what am I trying to say?</li>
					<li>What is the page trying to achieve? </li>
					<li>What response (if any) would you like? </li>
			</ul>	

			<p>The most important personas for the ICC website are: international journalist, national journalist (situation country), academic/lawyer, NGO legal officer, diplomat. <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/181138235/ICC-Personas ">Find out more about the needs and frustrations of these users.</a></p> 

	<h3>Active voice</h3>
	<p>Use the active voice rather than passive voice whenever possible.</p>

	<h3>Be concise</h3>
	<ul>
			<li>Use short sentences</li>
			<li>Don't create walls of text. Use sections (250 words max) with clear and informative headings</li>
			<li>Use bullet points and lists if appropriate</li>
		</ul>	

	<h3>Donâ€™t be stuffy</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Try to use the language of every day speech</li>
		<li>Avoid legalese, jargon, euphemisms, obscure Latin terms, unexplained acronyms and abbreviations</li>
		<li>Check the terms users search for and incorporate them (PIDS can help with this process if required)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Address the user</h3>	
	<p>Refer to the user as "you" unless the effect is jarring. For example, "You can contact us by phone or email."</p>

	<h3>Don't duplicate information</h3>	
	<p>Avoid including chunks of text when that text has been published elsewhere on the site. For example, refer to an article in the Rome Statute and link to the article rather than including the article in the text.</p>
	<p>In practice, there will always be a balance between providing context and explanation and linking to a reference, but the idea is to cut down the amount of text (c.f. current ICC site) and to avoid repetition across the site.</p>
